**Notes / Challenges :** (Write about problems faced, solutions, clarifications asked, etc.)

Day 01: Practiced loops and conditionals. Faced minor issue with while loop syntax.
In this i had only one difficulty that is understanding the problem statement
later i can understand the problem statements

Day 02: Learned constructor overloading. Initially confused about this() usage.
No problems faced

Day 03: CRUD operations using ArrayList. Understood importance of overriding equals().
Previously i had theoritical knowledge abount CRUD operations but never implemented,
Now with this training i have a greate oppertunity to implement all the CRUD operations.
NO difficulty.

Day 04: Tried custom exceptions. Need clarity on throw vs throws.
I had only one difficulty in extending a class  
wether RuntimeException or Exception
I did search on that thing now i can somehow managed to uderstand.

Day 05: Started with Stream API. Experimented with Comparator.comparing() and .reversed().
yeah defenatly i faced a difficulty in implementing comparator or in crerating aomparator in the beginning.
but when i used to creating comparator class i understand the comparator concept and how to implement it.
